In the earlier post, we were investigating why the MingW-w64 build of
DuckDB fails to export the C-API symbols in the final DLL.  We
identified the issue was introduced by the commit
[d1ea1538](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/commit/d1ea1538c9217fb536485f1500f04a0b55b1e584).
However we could not ascertain the underlying reason for the problem.
To take this further, let us try to isolate which part of the change
was the cause.

## A dead-end

With the objective of identifying the source file responsible for the
bug, we can start by inspecting the different build artifacts, and
checking for the C-API symbols.  But first, we need to log all the
build commands.  It is much easier to do this with Make than Ninja
(default generator for DuckDB).  We can choose our generator by
calling CMake as:

```bash
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ...
```

We can then log all the build commands by starting a verbose build
with Make:

```bash
$ VERBOSE=1 make -j6 |& tee build.log
```

With all the build commands recorded to a log file, I searched for
commands that create the shared library `libduckdb.dll`, and narrowed
it down to the following set of build commands:

```bash
$ /usr/bin/cmake -E rm -f CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a
$ /usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar qc CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a @CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects1.rsp
$ /usr/lib64/ccache/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -shared -o libduckdb.dll \
    -Wl,--out-implib,libduckdb.dll.a -Wl,--major-image-version,0,--minor-image-version,0 -Wl,--whole-archive \
    CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive @CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/linkLibs.rsp
```

Going through the steps individually, we will see that even though the
symbols are present in the earlier steps, the final library creation
step drops them.

### Tracing through the build steps

Let us first look for the object file that has the C-API symbols.

```bash
$ tr ' ' '\n' <CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects1.rsp | grep capi.cpp
main/capi/CMakeFiles/duckdb_main_capi.dir/ub_duckdb_main_capi.cpp.obj
```

We can then check for the C-API symbols in the object, and confirm
that the object file is included in the objects archive.

```bash
$ nm -C main/capi/CMakeFiles/duckdb_main_capi.dir/ub_duckdb_main_capi.cpp.obj | grep duckdb_vector_size
0000000000004f60 T duckdb_vector_size
$ /usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar t CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a | grep capi.cpp
ub_duckdb_main_capi.cpp.obj
```

If we check for the C-API symbols again in the archive file, we see
they are present and publicly visible (exported).

```bash
$ nm -C CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a | grep duckdb_vector_size
0000000000004f60 T duckdb_vector_size
$ winedump -j export CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a | grep duckdb_vector_size
 31a0ae4 duckdb_vector_size
```

Finally we can create the shared library by calling the linker.

```bash
$ /usr/lib64/ccache/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -shared -o libduckdb.dll \
    -Wl,--out-implib,libduckdb.dll.a -Wl,--major-image-version,0,--minor-image-version,0 -Wl,--whole-archive \
    CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/objects.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive @CMakeFiles/duckdb.dir/linkLibs.rsp
```

We see that while the C-API symbols are present, they are not
exported!

```bash
$ nm -C libduckdb.dll | grep duckdb_vector_size
00000001f3d116e0 T duckdb_vector_size
$ winedump -j export libduckdb.dll | grep duckdb_vector_size # no match
```

## A clue

Since so far we could not isolate the issue to a source file, next I
decided to "bisect" the contents of the problem commit.  As the issue
is with C-API symbols, I started with the files that have these
symbols:

- `src/include/duckdb.h`,
- `src/main/capi/aggregate_function-c.cpp`, and
- `test/api/capi/capi_aggregate_functions.cpp`.

I commented out parts of the above files, while ensuring the build
still succeeds, and checking for the C-API symbols in the final DLL in
the usual way with `nm` and `winedump`.  This led me to discover that
the _problem disappears if we reorder the include headers_ in
`src/main/capi/aggregate_function-c.cpp`.  You can see the change in
this PR:
[duckdb/duckdb#16396](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16396/files).

This is of course not the correct solution, since there should not be
any dependence on the order in which we include headers.  It is
indicative of an underlying bug.  This means some definition in the
headers is being overridden silently.  This can only happen for
preprocessor macros, anything else would trigger a compilation error.

## Solution to the mystery!

After further investigation from DuckDB core developer Mark Raasveldt,
the issue was resolved in this PR:
[duckdb/duckdb#13697](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/16397).
So what was the issue?

When building shared libraries for Windows, the public API has to be
marked for export.  This is done by adding the `__declspec(dllexport)`
[attribute](./2025-02-15-duckdb-julia-windows.md#symbol-visibility-in-windows-dlls)
to the relevant symbols.  In the DuckDB codebase this is done by
defining a macro `DUCKDB_API` that expands to that attribute.  However
there were two such definitions, they were in:

- `src/include/duckdb.h`, and
- `src/include/duckdb/common/winapi.hpp`.

Superficially they seem equivalent, however they are actually used in
slightly different contexts.  The macro defined in `duckdb.h` is used
to annotate symbols that are part of the *C-API*.  Whereas the macro
defined in `winapi.hpp` is used to mark symbols that comprise the *C++
API*.  In an earlier commit
([367595af](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/commit/367595af51b459d07121647bc2de1beabc836e0c)),
the macro defined in `winapi.hpp` was changed to exclude MingW builds.

 #else
```

### The reason & the fix

When exporting symbols, MingW normally excludes inline functions (see
`man x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` and search for
`-fkeep-inline-functions`).  The macro redefinition handles this case
by excluding symbol export for MingW.

Now in the DuckDB source, depending on which definition is seen first,
symbols may or may not be exported.  This of course depends on the
order of the include headers.

- If `DUCKDB_API` in `duckdb.h` is seen first, symbols are exported
  correctly, on the other hand
- if `DUCKDB_API` in `winapi.hpp` is seen first, symbols are not
  exported.

The final fix was to rename one of the macros to make the two
definitions distinct so that they do not interfere with each other;
i.e.

- `DUCKDB_API` in `duckdb.h` was renamed to `DUCKDB_C_API`, and
- `DUCKDB_API` in `winapi.hpp` remains unchanged.

## What did we learn?

After this resolution, any project reliant on this build can update to
the latest version of DuckDB starting from version 1.2.1.  In our case
that is the Julia binding for DuckDB, `DuckDB.jl`.  If we look at the
original issue:
[duckdb/duckdb#13911](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/13911),
there are many different projects reliant on it, so the impact of this
fix is quite broad!

And during this investigation, we also learnt:
1. bisection is an incredibly effective idea that can be used in many
   different contexts, and
2. macro hygiene is important in C/C++ code bases.
